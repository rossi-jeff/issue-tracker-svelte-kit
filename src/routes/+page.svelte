<h1>Welcome to Issue Tracker</h1>

<div class="mb-4">
	This site is a functional example of an issue tracking application. All of the existing data has
	been generated randomly. It is not intended to be used as a replacement for current leaders in the
	field such as Jira. The goal of the site is simply a proof of concept for an issue tracking
	application.
</div>

<div class="mb-4">
	Construction of this site used the component based framework <a
		href="https://kit.svelte.dev/"
		target="_blank">Svelte Kit</a
	>
	and the CSS framework <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/" target="_blank">Tailwind CSS.</a> The benefit
	of using a component based framework is that it becomes easier to follow the DRY ( don't repeat yourself
	) principle. In addition, effort was made not to reinvent the wheel.
</div>

<div class="mb-4">
	This site is one of four front end sites that share a common backend api. The font end sites are
	composed using the frameworks:
	<ul>
		<li><a href="https://react.dev/" target="_blank">React</a></li>
		<li><a href="https://vuejs.org/" target="_blank">Vue</a></li>
		<li><a href="https://angular.io/" target="_blank">Angular</a></li>
		<li><a href="https://svelte.dev/" target="_blank">Svelte</a></li>
	</ul>
	The backend api was composed using
	<a href="https://nestjs.com/" target="_blank">Nestjs</a>.
</div>

<div class="mb-4">The source code for all sites is available upon request.</div>
